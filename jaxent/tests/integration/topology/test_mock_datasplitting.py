"""
This test is the precursor to the completed data splitting class,
this tests the overall workflow of the data splitting process in a similar way to the data splitting class in split.py
This test loads test pdb, extracts the Partial_Topology from that universe and then splits the data into training and validation sets.
The test then checks that the data is split correctly using various assertions.
